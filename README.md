# GNU-lish
Fninally we cnan cnommunicate with each gnanother.

## Basic rules
GNU-lish is based on English, but adds some additional rules. Please note that this README is mostly written in normal English, because otherwise recursion would occur, which would be unhandy.

1. All of the following rules have to be obeyed in the order they appear.
2. Words with less two or less letters must never be altered.
3. Words that have a consonant as first letter, and a vowel as second letter, and a consonent as third letter, must be altered by inserting an "n" between the first and second letter
