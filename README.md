# GNU-lish
Fninally we cnan cnommunicate with each gnanother.

## Basic rules
GNU-lish is based on English, but adds some additional rules. Please note that this README is mostly written in normal English, because otherwise recursion would occur, which would be unhandy.

1. All of the following rules have to be obeyed in the order they appear.
2. Names of persons (both "real life" and "internet" names) must never be altered
3. None of the further rules must be applied if it would make the resulting word hard to pronounce. (e.g. "loom" must be turned into "lnoom" as per rule #5)
4. Words with two or less letters must never be altered.
5. Words that have a consonant as first letter, and a vowel as second letter must be altered by inserting an "n" between the first and second letter, unless the word starts with "vowel-like" letter (like "y") (e.g. "human" -> "hnuman")
6. Rule #3 also applies to words where the third letter is the same as the second letter (e.g. "google" -> "gnoogle")
7. Words starting with a vowel have to be prepended with "gn" (or "Gn" if the first letter was uppercase)
